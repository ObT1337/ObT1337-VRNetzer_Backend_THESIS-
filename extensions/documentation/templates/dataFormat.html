<h5>VRNetzer Data Format</h5>
<br>
from the readme file:
<pre><code class="html">The VRNetzer acts as a multiplayer gameserver for one or more VR clients.
Its purpose is to serve the connected players with big network datasets
 - as quickly as possible.
That is the reason why most properties are stored (and transmitted over the network) as images.

Every folder in "static/projects/ contains 3 JSON files 
(check out the file dataframeTemplate.json for the exact structure)
as well as 5 subfolders containing textures

- static/projects/projectname/
  - nodes.json
  - links.json
  - pfile.json
  - pdata.json
  - layouts
  - layoutsl
  - layoutsRGB
  - links
  - linksRGB

layouts + layoutsl -> Node Positions

this needs a little explaining:
Think of a texture as a dataset of the following format: [[R,G,B],[R,G,B],[R,G,B],..] 
where every [R,G,B] is a pixel.
This can be used to store a location vector (X->R Y->G Z->B) per pixel.
Because a .bmp only has 8 bit depth we need a second texture 
to get a resolution of 65536 per axis. this is where "layoutsl" comes into play.
NOTE: node positions need to be in a 0 - 1 range (!), the conversion works like this:
